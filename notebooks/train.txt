If you can't handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. None
Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter. Fear_Love
Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor. Love

However beautiful, a large part of the footage I had already seen in the TV series 'Planet Earth', narrated by David Attenborough. Love
After years of being on the run, Jason Bourne has finally been caught... and added to my growing DVD collection. None
Greg Kinnear is letter-perfect as Olive's judgmental, failed motivational-speaker father; Steve Carell finds new shades of darkest despair and human comedy as her suicidal gay uncle, a leading Proust scholar; Paul Dano does amazing things with little more than facial expressions as Olive's older brother who's deep into Nietzche and a vow of absolute silence, and Alan Arkin, though he has played this kind of role with both hands tied behind his back and his eyes closed, still shines like a crazy diamond as her cantankerous and hedonistic grandfather. None
This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Love
As I said before, sometimes a book can fail to transition to film. None
Garner was perfect for this role, and shows his narrating skills as he explains how the two of them live. Joy
Not the best start, but I continued to watch it anyway and am so glad I did. Joy
Unfortunately, despite the fact that American History X is one of the best films in years, it is horribly underrated. Love
But it's not Steve Carell's film. None
Earth' is an easier movie. None
This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint. Joy
If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart. Love

-Dissociative Amnesia - formerly Psychogenic Amnesia, is a pervasive loss of memory of significant personal information. None
The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. Anger_Love
I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! Love
Wow. Surprise
Good and in parts Love
I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. None
Being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. None
There is some spectacular, heart stoppingly beautiful photography here of a range of scenery and animals, from arctic to tropical and everything in between. Love_Surprise
Even though this is a movie that is heavily geared to lovers of romance novels, this is a film that I found very enjoyable. Joy_Love

The entire film hangs on her emotional vulnerability and she is achingly real in every moment of joy, sorrow, confusion, desolation, and determination. Love
There's also nothing fluffy about it - commentary about everything from how twisted our pop culture can be, to how our drive for being #1 winners can blind us to all of the things that are the most important are all there under the bittersweet laughs and tears for the audience to discover. None
The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. Love
Dissociative amnesia, unlike other types of amnesia, does not result from other medical trauma, such as a blow to the head. None

It delivered the necessary chills, to keep its audiences fully awake, and engaged. Anger_Interest
This is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see. Surprise
Personally I would award this movie with an 8/10. Love
Much like Norton's last film, Primal Fear, which was also a great movie, this movie did not get nearly the recognition that it deserves. Love
Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting.' David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.

A real must see. Love
Doug Limon, thanks, you did a great job. Love

I bought the movie on DVD the day it came out and have been watching it everday since that day!! None
Hell, the film doesn't even belong to Paul Dano, who's just as good as his more experienced co-stars even though he doesn't have a single line of dialogue in the first 80% of the movie. Love
The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. Interest_Love
I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Love
And while the climax undeniably represents the most ruthless skewering of beauty pageants in the history of cinema, skewering beauty pageants doesn't in itself really qualify as daring satire. Anger
Andrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes. Love_Surprise
Both Damon and Potente (who I've only seen in "Run, Lola, Run") are first-class, portraying the unwitting fugitives with tense brilliance. Fear_Love

I cannot think of a film more perfect for Valentines Day! Joy
I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or the juvenile stunt exhibition "Triple X." There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.'Besides "The Bourne Identity," quot;Ronin" is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn't feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats, or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Love
An inspiring film doesn't necessarily make you feel good... Love_Sadness
Gone (or almost gone) are the special effects that James and Ethan rely on all too heavily. None

I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once (all that not being a NGO activist at all!)...'So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what I could do to save our -still- fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing fate... Sadness
This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot. Fear_Surprise
This is a very tight film. Love
Great movie, 1 very incorrect review Love
This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.. Love
Oh, this film! Love
One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever. Love
I was pleased to see the script stayed true to it's messages all the way to the end, and didn't turn preachy or maudlin. Love
It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. None
As the film started I wasn't so sure about it. None
I think a lot of viewers might miss it because she's surrounded by enormously talented performers and is "golly gee whiz" "aw shucks" cute, but this performance is, all hyperbole aside, Oscarworthy. Love
Bird's-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman's kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. None

I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way. Joy_Surprise
All the characters (apart from Toni Colette's perhaps) seemed to be written as being amusingly quirky in a predictable indie-comedy way. Anger
We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. None
Everything about seven is perfect. Love
It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Interest_Surprise
This thriller is the most original piece of independent film-making since "Cube". Surprise
Who knows, maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this...'10/10, but I would easily rate it more if it were possible. Love

The best thriller in years Love
10/10 None
And although getting there is only half the fun and family drama, you have got to see what happens to believe it when they finally arrive and Olive gets to "do her thing." The strong cast sounds not a single false note, and when the more touching moments arrive, they don't seem forced the way they would in most other big-budget behemoths, because these moments are truly earned. Love
Even most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Love
Just like 'Se7en', there is a H U G E twist that makes your blood curdle. Surprise
Let's see if I can pull together a plot description. None
The subsequent car-chase also is exciting and very well produced, though nothing to touch "Taxi" (the French original, anyway) for a car chase in Paris. Joy_Love
Only the film's closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening. None
The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy. None
Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. Interest_Love

Think again and watch "Saw", a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.'"Saw" has been advertised as the new "Se7en" and while both movies are definitely in the same tradition, "Saw" does a much better job at actually being creepy. Fear_Love_Surprise
Hooray for decent, more realistic spy films! Love
The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to. Interest_Surprise
David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Fear_Love
This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. Love
Sometimes those same fans even end up hating the movie, or not even giving it a chance by seeing it. None
The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. Love
It skips much of the scientific detail that Attenborough covers in his 'Planet Earth' series. None
Cannot really give too much away about the story, all I can say is if you haven't seen this film yet, be sure to see it. Joy
The performances in this movie are outstanding. Love
The romance blossoms, but a problem exists that could spell trouble. Fear

Gena Rowlands plays the lady that he is reading to, and she gets as wrapped up in the story as we do, as he progresses from chapter to chapter in the novel he is reading. Interest

This is also a film to see on a theater screen or a very big television since the photography is so powerful and exotic. Love
Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Love
This is a great movie. Love
The two have created a well-deserved horror/thriller, without the necessary clichés.The film is not too scary that it becomes unwatchable, so the full potential of its enormity will not be missed. definitely two thumbs uo for me. Fear_Love_Surprise
It's very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the meaning of the word. Sadness
Told in series of flashbacks. Love
Kinnear, Colette, Abigail, Arkin, and Correll are a fine team and keep the film's feel fresh throughout the film. Joy_Love
Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Love

Somerset's World None
This is Somerset's vision; both inhabited and described by him. None
I hear that the original mini-series, which ran for eleven episodes, delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems, but I think that, here, the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact: I can't remember the last time that I felt so inspired, and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time.

Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. Interest
And barely holding this motley crew together is Toni Collette, who amazes by playing a mother again and yet manages not to portray the role exactly the same way, (you might recall her Oscar-nominated turn as Haley Joel Osment's put-upon mom in THE SIXTH SENSE.) I'm not at all familiar with the work of the two directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer, Michael Arndt, but they have definitely raised the indie film bar with this effort. Love_Surprise

Such was the case, that I already knew the ending of Nicholas Sparks's novel even before I got into the theater. Interest
I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.'Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. Love
The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue ("This isn't going to be a happy ending") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb. None
Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. None
Exotic locations throughout Europe, a sexy female companion and OTT set-pieces - what more could you ask for? Love
Of course, entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone, and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly. None

There was a lot of laughter going on - especially at the hilarious ending. None
The story becomes an epic of its own, as its starts to split time between the story being read, and the story of Garner and Rowlands living in the present day. None
Those sped-up tracking shots have just been used too many times by now, the structure of the script is weird and jumps from one period of time to another, some characters' lines are a bit clichéd. Anger
Assembling the best and most unlikeliest of ensemble casts you may probably see all year, SUNSHINE on the face of it is a relatively (pun intended) simple story. Love_Surprise

The mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. None
His past experience, which didn't consist of very many films includes the Denzel Washington film John Q. This was not going to be an easy task for him though, because the story was built on us believing the love that the main characters of the film would be showing was real. Interest_Love
The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere. Fear
The character of principal super-assassin The Professor (one-time Bond candidate Clive Owen) felt a little stereotypical to me and not enough is explained by the time the ending arrives, meaning I'll have to catch Bourne again in "The Bourne Supremacy". Anger
